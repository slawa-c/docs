Openssl


- Generate Pem Keys with OpenSSL on macOS

1. Update OpenSSL
// Check OpenSSL version
openssl version

Case 1: You are already using OpenSSL
// Update homebrew itself
brew update
// Update OpenSSL
brew upgrade openssl

Case 2: You are currently using LibreSSL
brew update
brew list openssl

Case 3: You don't OpenSSL 
// Only if you don't have OpenSSL installed
brew install openssl
// If you already have OpenSSL, update the package
brew upgrade openssl

brew info openssl
// Will return...
openssl: stable 1.0.2t (bottled) [keg-only]
SSL/TLS cryptography library
...
If you need to have openssl first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
...


// Check OpenSSL version again
openssl version


2. Generate

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -aes-256-cbc -outform PEM -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
phrase -> 

>>
-genpkey
This command generates a private key. This command is not supported in the old versions of OpenSSL.
-algorithm RSA
Specifies the algorithm to use it for the key. 
You can use other algorithms such as DH, EC and DSA. 
This website is good for roughly understanding the differences between each algorithm.
-aes-256-cbc
This option specifies the cypher used to encrypt the private key. 
A cypher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption. 
According to the OpenSSL documentation, any algorithm accepted by EVP_get_cipherbyname() is acceptable. 
The -aes-256-cbc cypher will encrypt the key and asks for a password to use.
-outform PEM
Specifies the output format. The DER format is also available.
-out private_key.pem
Output the key with the specified file. In this case, the filename would be ‘private_key.pem’.
-pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
The -pkeyopt option sets the public key algorithm. Available options for the command are listed here. 
In this case, rsa_keygen_bits:2048 specifies the length of the generated key. If not 2048 is used by default. 
The longer length will enhance the security, however, it will take more time to process.


2. Permission
chmod 0400 private_key.pem

3. Export the public key
ssh-keygen -e -f private_key.pem > public_key.pem

>>
-ssh-keygen
This is the command to generate, manage and convert authentication keys for ssh. This command is available in macOS by default.
-e
This option reads a private or public key and allows exporting keys.
-f
This is the option to specify the source filename.
